# MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification Using RNN

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** to classify handwritten digits from the **MNIST dataset**. Instead of using a CNN, each image is treated as a **sequence**, allowing the RNN to learn patterns row‑by‑row.

The complete implementation is available in a Jupyter Notebook.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Understand digit classification using RNNs
* Learn how images can be treated as sequences
* Build and train an RNN model using TensorFlow/Keras
* Evaluate model performance on test data

---

## 📂 Key Concepts Covered

* Loading the MNIST dataset
* Image preprocessing and normalization
* Reshaping images into sequential format
* Building an RNN model
* Training and evaluating the network
* Visualizing accuracy and loss

---

## 🧵 Dataset Description

The **MNIST dataset** consists of grayscale handwritten digit images:

* **60,000** training images
* **10,000** test images
* Image size: **28 × 28 pixels**
* Digit classes: **0 to 9**

---

## 🧠 Model Architecture

Each 28×28 image is reshaped into a sequence of **28 time steps**, with **28 pixel values per step**.

The RNN model includes:

* **Input Sequence Layer** – pixel rows as sequences
* **Recurrent Layer** (SimpleRNN / LSTM / GRU)
* **Dense Output Layer** – softmax activation for digit prediction

This approach allows the RNN to learn spatial relationships along image rows.

## 📊 Training & Evaluation

* **Optimizer:** Adam
* **Loss Function:** Categorical Crossentropy
* **Metric:** Accuracy

Steps include training on the training set and evaluating accuracy on the test set. Training curves are plotted for performance analysis.
